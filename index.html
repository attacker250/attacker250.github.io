                                Curves. They exist in almost everything we see in reality and on the computer. Some curves are incredibly small, some are big.
                                Some are uniform and some are varied. Take the curves on the right for example.

                                Curves don't just exist in what we can see. They also exist in math. They can describe speed. They can describe height. They can even describe emotion. 
                                Curves are one of the most important things in graphs.

                        <div class="left">
                            <p>So, I'll just give you the formula first. The formula for calculating a bezier curve is! *Drum roll*(play drum roll sound) (1-t)*P0 + t(P1).
                               Its less complicated looking than it seems huh(Just to let you know, I'm using the wonderful literary device known as foreshadowing). Let's break down this formula.
                               First off, what's P0 and P1? They refer to coordinates. These coordinates define where the line starts and ends. The "t" or T value refers to the percentage of the line.
                               If say you want to get the coordinates of 50% along a line, you can use this. Oh I lied by the way. This isnt how you formulate bezier curves. This is only a part of it.
