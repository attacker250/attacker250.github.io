                                Curves. They exist in almost everything we see in reality and on the computer. Some curves are incredibly small, some are big.
                                Some are uniform and some are varied. Take the curves on the right for example.

                                Curves are one of the most important things in graphs.

                        <h3>So, how do we calculate bezier curves?</h3>
                        <div class="middle">
                            <p>So, I'll just give you the formula first. The formula for calculating a bezier curve is! *Drum roll*(play drum roll sound) (1-t)*P0 + t(P1).
                               Its less complicated looking than it seems huh(Just to let you know, I'm using the wonderful literary device known as foreshadowing). Let's break down this formula.
                               First off, what's P0 and P1? They refer to coordinates. These coordinates define where our curve starts and ends. The "t" or T value refers to the percentage of the line.
                               If say you want to get the coordinates of 50% along a line, you can use this formula to get the coordinate. Oh by the way, this formula won't yield a curve yet. All it does it give you a straight line.

                                So, what is interpolation? Officially it is the process of determining unknown values between two points.
                                 The fornmula does exactly that. Try out this calculator.

                            <p>
                                Interpolation allows us to do quite a bit of things but its main purpose in this article is to calculate bezier curves.
                                Interpolation is quite literally the foundation of bezier curves so it is important to understand it properly. I'll explain how interpolation is utilised in the next section:

                                Here, we begin to actually get into making a curve. Ta da!. So, how is this curve even made? Essentially, this curve is the result of many interpolations.
                                 This gif over here will demonstrate.

                                So, what do I mean by many interpolations? What we do here is bassicaly first interpolating between our defined points or our control points, 
                                then interpolating the interpolation of those two points. This may seem complicated on paper but, when you look at it through the gif above, it makes more sense.
