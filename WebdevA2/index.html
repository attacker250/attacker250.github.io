                                Curves. They exist in almost everything we see in reality and on the computer. Some curves are incredibly small, some are big.
                                Some are uniform and some are varied. Take the curves on the right for example.

                                Curves are one of the most important things in graphs.

                        <h3>So, how do we calculate bezier curves?</h3>
                        <div class="middle">
                            <p>So, I'll just give you the formula first. The formula for calculating a bezier curve is! <span id="drums">*Drum roll*</span>(1-t)*P0 + t(P1).
                               Its less complicated looking than it seems huh(Just to let you know, I'm using the wonderful literary device known as foreshadowing). Let's break down this formula.
                               First off, what's P0 and P1? They refer to coordinates. These coordinates define where our curve starts and ends. The "t" or T value refers to the percentage of the line.
                               If say you want to get the coordinates of 50% along a line, you can use this formula to get the coordinate. Oh by the way, this formula won't yield a curve yet. All it does it give you a straight line.

                                So, what is interpolation? Officially it is the process of determining unknown values between two points.
                                 The fornmula does exactly that. Try out this calculator.

                                Interpolation allows us to do quite a bit of things but its main purpose in this article is to calculate bezier curves.
                                Interpolation is quite literally the foundation of bezier curves so it is important to understand it properly. I'll explain how interpolation is utilised in the next section:

                                Here, we begin to actually get into making a curve. Ta da!. So, how is this curve even made? Essentially, this curve is the result of many interpolations.
                                 This gif over here will demonstrate. 
                            </p>

                                So, what do I mean by many interpolations? What we do here is bassicaly first interpolating between our defined points or our control points, 
                                then interpolating the interpolation of those two points. This may seem complicated on paper but, when you look at it through the gif above, it makes more sense.

                                Cubic Bezier Curves are exactly like Quadratic bezier curves. Only with more interpolating and more complexity. This gif should help you visualise this.
                                When we add more points onto a curve, we have to interpolate more and more. While we can reach an infinite number of points, it may not be the best solution to
                                creating most shapes.

                            <p>As you may have noticed, the more points we add on a bezier curve, the more complex shapes we can make. Strictly speaking, it'd be much more efficient if
                                we use multiple Quadratic or Cubic bezier curves to construct our shape but its if we need to be very specific with a particular line, 
                                adding more points may be the way to go.

                                Game developers usually automate this process by performing some calculations on enemy and player position rather than 
                                defining these points manually.

                                While I could go on and on about more examples of bezier curves, Im certain that you, the reader have found many things built with 
                                the wonderful thing called a bezier curve. So, now I implore you to go out there and make some more beautiful things with what you've
                                learnt.
